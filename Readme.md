# AWS Starter App

Production-ready AWS infrastructure using Terraform with modular architecture and environment-specific configurations.

## Architecture Overview

**Modular Design**: Each numbered directory represents a deployable unit with proper dependency ordering.

**Environment Isolation**: Separate configurations in `infra/environments/prod/` with dedicated state management.

**Configurable Modules**: Following standardized pattern with comprehensive variables, remote state integration, and production defaults.

## Module Status

### âœ… **Tested & Deployed**
- **01_cognito**: User authentication with Cognito User Pool
- **02_network**: VPC with multi-AZ subnets and IPv6 support

### âœ… **Refactored to Environment Pattern**
- **03_rds**: PostgreSQL database with encryption and configurable sizing
- **04_ec2**: Application servers with configurable instance types and storage
- **04a_ec2_alb**: ALB integration for EC2 instances with path-based routing
- **10_ecs**: Standalone ECS service with Fargate (single-task, direct IP)
- **10a_ecs_alb**: ECS ALB integration for high availability and load balancing

### ðŸ”„ **Available Modules (Pending Environment Testing)**
- **02a_alb**: Application Load Balancer with SSL/TLS
- **05_ec2_rds**: Database connectivity and security groups
- **06_sqs**: Message queuing for async processing
- **07_lambda**: Serverless functions and triggers
- **08_commons**: Shared security, logging, and storage
- **09_svc_user**: External service access with IAM

## Deployment Process

### Prerequisites
1. Deploy `00_ops_foundation/00_state_bucket` (root credentials)
2. Deploy `00_ops_foundation/01_terraform_user` (root credentials)
3. Switch to terraform-user credentials for all subsequent operations

### Environment Deployment
```bash
cd infra/environments/prod/{module_name}
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

### Dependency Order
1. âœ… Authentication (Cognito)
2. âœ… Network (VPC, Subnets)  
3. ðŸ”„ Load Balancer (ALB)
4. âœ… Database (RDS) - *Module refactored, environment ready*
5. âœ… Compute (EC2) - *Module refactored, environment ready*
6. âœ… ALB Integration (EC2-ALB) - *Separated module for clean architecture*
7. ðŸ”„ Connectivity (EC2-RDS)
8. ðŸ”„ Messaging (SQS)
9. ðŸ”„ Serverless (Lambda)
10. ðŸ”„ Commons (Security, Logging)
11. âœ… Container Service (ECS) - *Standalone module ready*
12. âœ… Container ALB (ECS-ALB) - *ALB integration module ready*
13. ðŸ”„ Service Users (External Access)

## Recent Updates

### Infrastructure Improvements
- **RDS Module**: Refactored with configurable sizing, encryption defaults, and environment structure
- **EC2 Module**: Enhanced with instance type selection, storage configuration, and security settings
- **ALB Integration**: Separated into dedicated module for clean separation of concerns
- **ECS Modules**: Split into standalone service (10_ecs) and ALB integration (10a_ecs_alb) patterns
- **Remote State**: All modules now use remote state for proper dependency management

### ECS Architecture Patterns
**Standalone ECS (10_ecs)**:
- Single-task deployment with direct IP access
- Cost-effective for development and simple services
- No ALB dependency, optional auto-scaling
- ECS Exec enabled for container debugging

**ECS with ALB (10a_ecs_alb)**:
- High-availability deployment with load balancing
- Path-based routing and health checks
- Multi-AZ redundancy and zero-downtime deployments
- Production-ready with advanced monitoring

### Environment Structure
All refactored modules follow standardized pattern:
- Production defaults optimized for cost and security
- Comprehensive variable organization with logical grouping
- Remote state integration between dependent modules
- Detailed outputs with CLI examples for operational use

## Next Steps

### ðŸŽ¯ **Immediate Priority: ECS Module Testing**
Testing the separated ECS deployment patterns:
1. Deploy standalone ECS service and verify container functionality
2. Deploy ECS ALB integration and test load balancing
3. Validate path-based routing and health checks
4. Test ECS Exec debugging capabilities
5. Verify auto-scaling behavior (when enabled)

### ðŸ”„ **Infrastructure Integration Testing**
Complete end-to-end testing for refactored modules:
1. Deploy RDS environment and verify connectivity
2. Deploy EC2 environment and confirm instance configuration
3. Deploy ALB integration and test load balancing
4. Validate inter-module state sharing and dependencies
5. Verify operational procedures (backup, monitoring, scaling)

### ðŸ”„ **Module Conversion Pipeline**
Continue refactoring remaining modules to environment pattern:
- Modules 02a_alb through 09_svc_user following dependency order
- Standardize variable organization and remote state integration
- Add production-optimized defaults and comprehensive outputs

**Goal**: Fully functional production environment with containerized services, load balancing, database, and monitoring.
